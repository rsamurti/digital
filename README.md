Digital Sargam is a modern system of musical notation for the sitar. It's very easy to learn and use, and doesn't require any prior formal music training. Most of the written notation examples are illustrated by audio MP3 files, in the accompanying folder called audio. Theyâ€™ve been played on the sitar in the key of D. References in the text indicate which audio files correspond to which example. Read the PDF version of this document using Acrobat Reader to find out how to read and write Digital Sargam. The audio files are embedded directly into the PDF document - click the play button to hear them. If you would like to contribute to the future development of Digital Sargam, please post questions and comments in the project wiki.
